Songs of Quantum
===========

Songs of Quantuum is a Web Wargame featuring the war across the stars between 3 races: the Terrestris, the Kriives and the Gamicronians.

- The Terrestris are nothing else than the Humans we all know, except they're a little more advanced than us since the 24th century has come.
- The Kriiv is an insectoid race who loves to grow quietly in asteroids belts, singing on their biological network which connects them to the Higher Consciousness level.
- The Gamicronians are literally thinking stones as old as the universe himself, delegating tasks to their legions of automated workers from their huge space fortresses.
